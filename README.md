This repository contains the work we completed for our final project for APMA0360 at Brown University. The group members were Mary Dong, Jennifer He, Peter Huson, Wen Yuan, and Minna Kimura-Thollander.

Our main work includes:
* Preprocessing the Digg dataset
* Producing exploratory plots for the dataset (such as a social media network graph)
* Creating a spatiotemporal SI model 
* Creating a Linear and Logistical Diffusive Model
* Evaluating all models with respect to the most popular Digg story by fitting our parameters and calculating accuracy

You can find the epidemiological model in the <tt>/epidemic</tt> folder, and the linear and logistic models in the <tt>/linear_logistic</tt> folder.
